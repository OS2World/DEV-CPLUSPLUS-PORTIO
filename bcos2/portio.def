; Dynamic link library providing inp, outp, inpw, outpw to BCOS2
;
; This definition module defines the exports available in the .DLL file
; to be created.  This is the "safe" way to use inp/outp since the code
; is physically separated, and only this DLL is given IOPL priveleges.
;
; Specification of the CODE IOPL or SEGMENTS _TEXT IOPL statements causes
; a "general error" in TLINK.  This should be no problem since giving IOPL
; priviledges to all the code in an EXE or DLL would be foolish.
;
; Explanation of some statements
;
; LIBRARY PORTIO                  Name of DLL (MUST match real name)
; CODE PRELOAD EXECUTEONLY IOPL   Default IOPL in segments of class CODE
;                                 Might as well preload since it is so
;                                 small, but mark execute only.
; PROTMODE                        This is a protect mode program only
; EXPORTS                         List of names exported by the DLL
; _inp                            External name of a _far16 _cdecl inp()
